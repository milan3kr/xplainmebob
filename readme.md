# Meet XPLAINBOB - Twitter Explainer Bot

BOB is a fun and quirky bot I built to help make sense of confusing tweets as a backup when explainthisbob was taken down and New Paid APIs were just introduced. Whenever you mention @xplainbob, it jumps into the conversation, grabs the original tweet, and gives a friendly, easy-to-understand explanation.

## What BOB Does

- **Listens:** BOB monitors mentions and joins the conversation when you tag it. 
- **Explains:** It fetches the original tweet and breaks it down with a touch of humor.
- **Introduces:** If someone asks, "Who are you?", BOB proudly says itâ€™s BOB, created by me!

## Getting BOB Up and Running

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BOB-explainer-bot.git
   cd BOB-explainer-bot

2. **Install Dependecies:**
   npm install

3. **Fill the env file with your api keys.**
   Remember you atleast need the basic plan of twitter premium api that costs $100 to fetch the tweet details. 

4. **Run NODE INDEX.JS to start the bot**

**@XPLAINBOB on X was only active for a month before it had to stop due to paid API limitations. The community I built it for was understanding of this, as continuing the bot could have posed risks, especially since X (formerly Twitter) no longer allows bots related to tokenized projects.**
